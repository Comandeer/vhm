# vhm

Simple utility for managing Apache's virtual hosts. It can create or delete vh with given name and options. Just run `vhm --help` to see all options

## Wildcard support
Wildcard support needs `dnsmasq`


## Privileges
vhm messes around with some configuration files, so probably you'll have to use `sudo`

## Errm
Yes, it's written only with me in mind and can be treated as an experiment with writing cli apps using node.js
